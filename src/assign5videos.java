/* Notes for week 5
 * 
 * encapsulation
 * like rectangle: length change should update area
 * don't want a setter for area; only a getter
 * 
 * hide data and use public methods
 * 
 * getters/setters / accessors/mutators
 * have to be public!
 * 
 * inheritance
 * 
 * parent or superclass to cover the subclasses
 * (employees to salaried, hourly and managers)
 * 
 * polymorphic
 * inherited in own way?
 * act differently on each class
 * 
 * cleaner code, easier to manage: oop
 * 
 * abstract class
 * abstract methods with signature but no body
 * leaves it up to the inheriting (sub?) class
 * limitations
 * can only inherit from one class
 * 
 * interface solves inheritance problem
 * only define signatures
 * again know what you want, but don't know how?
 * interface is a contract!
 * has to create concrete implementation 
 *
